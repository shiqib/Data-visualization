# Data Visualization Using Plotly.js
Data visualization

n this project, we’ll apply basic data visualization concepts using the Plotly.js library, which is a JavaScript open-source graphing library.

We can create more than 40 types of charts using Plotly, which includes multiple 3D charts, statistical graphs, and SVG maps. The best thing about Plotly is that we can easily create interactive and publication-quality graphs.

Since data visualization is a core concept of exploratory data analysis, our primary focus will be on statistical graphs in this project. We will create the following types of graphs in this project:

- Histogram
- Stacked histogram
- Pie chart
- Violin plot
- Bar chart
- Line chart
- Scatter plot
- Box plot

For this project, we will use the Heart Disease Data Set, the complete documentation for which can be found at this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).
